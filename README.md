# guanaco-web
This web application analyzes and visualizes the events generated by [events](guanaco-io/events).

## Build

Before you start...

- Install Elm 0.18.0 by running `npm install elm@0.18.0` in this directory

You should also have a MongoDB instance running and have access to Kafka for the event messages.

Afterwards, it's just Play! and SBT as usual.
